# Slicing-Cheatsheet-in-Python

ðŸ“Œ Basic Concepts of String Slicing in Python
Python slicing allows you to extract a portion of a string using a simple syntax.

The syntax is: s[start:stop:step]

Slicing does not modify the original string; it returns a new one.

start: Starting index (inclusive)

stop: Ending index (exclusive)

step: Interval or stride (optional)





âœ… Key Points:
Omitting start begins from the start of the string.

Omitting stop goes until the end of the string.

Omitting both gives a copy of the entire string.

Using a negative step reverses the direction.

Indexing can be positive (from left) or negative (from right).

Works not just with strings, but also with lists and tuples.
